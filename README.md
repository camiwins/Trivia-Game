# Trivia-Game
For this assignment, I chose to do the basic timed trivia game. I was hungry so I themed it to Chicken & Waffles, which is what I was craving at the time.

**Note From Cami** : I spent a few days trying to write the logic without any references and got further than I expected. It seems that going through old activities and practicing code drills helped me finally understand for loops. However, I couldn't figure out how to write the for loop to check answers, so I utilized the walkthrough video in the supplemental section.

# Instructions
* You have 20 seconds to answer 8 questions. 
* Press start button to see all the questions
* Select the answer you believe is right by clicking on the bubble
* Wait for the timer to run out
* Results page should populate at the end

Yes, I know these aren't factual but opinion based, but I believe in you and know you can do it.
